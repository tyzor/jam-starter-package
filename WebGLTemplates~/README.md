> **WARNING This is only for Unity 6 or higher!**

You can follow the [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/web-templates-add.html) for more information about Web Templates.

## Opening the wizard
Open the template wizard window in your project by navigating to `WebGL -> Template Wizard`

The wizard will allow you to configure settings of the WebGL template to be loaded at build time. The top of the window shows a small preview of what the current settings will look like.

Once you are satisfied with the look you can select `Create Template`.  If it doesn't exist, his will create a new directory in `/Assets/` called `/WebGLTemplates/`.  All the settings will be copied over to the `Player Settings` template variables.  Finally the `Player Settings` window will launch for any additional values to be configured.
