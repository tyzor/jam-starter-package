### `[ReadOnly]` Attribute
You can add this attribute to any serialized field _(For non-custom structs)_ and it will prevent the value from being edited
while keeping it visible, useful for debugger, or allowing designers to see what is happening.

```csharp
[SerializeField, ReadOnly, Min(0)]
private float speed;
private float _current;

[ReadOnly]
public int test;
```
